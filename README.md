Spatial variation of the mutation rate in apical meristems

This repo contains analysis code corresponding to Amundson et al 2025, divided into six workflows:

1_DMv6_provisional details analyses using DM1-3 v6.1 reference genome to uncover Red Polenta chimerism
2_assembly for primary assembly of the RP reference genome
3_annotation for annotation of the RP primary assembly
4_mutation_calling for identification of layer-specific mutations in Desiree and Red Polenta
